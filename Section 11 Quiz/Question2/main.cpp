/*
 * Write the following program: Create a struct that holds a studentâ€™s first name and grade (on a scale of 0-100).
 *
 * Ask the user how many students they want to enter.
 *
 * Create a std::vector to hold all of the students.
 * Then prompt the user for each name and grade.
 *
 * Once the user has entered all the names and grade pairs, sort the list by grade (highest first).
 * Then print all the names and grades in sorted order.
